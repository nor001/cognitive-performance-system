# HIIT Training

High-Intensity Interval Training protocols optimized for cognitive enhancement and time efficiency.

## Cognitive Benefits of HIIT

- Increased BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)
- Enhanced cerebral blood flow
- Improved executive function
- Neurogenesis in hippocampus
- Stress resilience
- Mitochondrial biogenesis

## Training Frequency

- **Optimal**: 3-4 sessions per week
- **Minimum**: 2 sessions per week
- **Maximum**: 5 sessions per week (with adequate recovery)
- **Rest**: Minimum 24 hours between sessions
- **De-load week**: Every 4th week reduce volume by 40%

## Session Timing

### Best Times for Cognitive Enhancement
1. **Late morning** (0930-1130): After morning cortisol peak
2. **Late afternoon** (1600-1800): Body temperature peak
3. **Avoid**: First 60 min after waking, within 4 hours of bedtime

### Scheduling Considerations
- Minimum 2 hours post-meal
- Minimum 4 hours before sleep (individual variation applies)
- Not before critical cognitive tasks (acute fatigue)
- Not after heavy cognitive load day (cumulative stress)

## Performance Tracking

### Metrics to Record
- Heart rate (average, max during work intervals)
- RPE for work and recovery intervals
- Number of rounds completed
- Work capacity (distance, power, or reps)
- Recovery heart rate (60 sec post-work)
- Session completion (yes/no)

### Monthly Assessment
- Compare week 1 vs week 4 metrics
- Track improvements: increased rounds, lower RPE at same output, faster heart rate recovery
- Adjust protocols if plateau >3 weeks

## Heart Rate Zones

### Calculate Max Heart Rate
- Method 1: 220 - age (general estimate)
- Method 2: 208 - (0.7 × age) (more accurate)
- Method 3: Field test (supervised max effort)

### Zone Definitions
- **Zone 1** (Recovery): 50-60% max HR
- **Zone 2** (Aerobic base): 60-70% max HR
- **Zone 3** (Tempo): 70-80% max HR
- **Zone 4** (Threshold): 80-90% max HR
- **Zone 5** (VO2 max): 90-100% max HR

### HIIT Applications
- Work intervals: Zone 4-5
- Recovery intervals: Zone 1-2

## Safety and Form

### Pre-Session Checklist
- Adequate sleep (minimum 6 hours)
- Hydrated (urine pale yellow)
- No illness or injury
- 2+ hours post-meal
- Appropriate footwear and surface

### Contraindications (skip session if present)
- Acute illness or infection
- Injury or pain
- Sleep <5 hours
- High stress/fatigue (accumulated)
- Heart rate variability (HRV) significantly below baseline

### Form Priorities
1. Maintain neutral spine
2. Controlled breathing (avoid breath-holding)
3. Full range of motion where applicable
4. Quality over quantity (reduce intensity if form breaks)

## Breathing Protocol

### During Work Intervals
- Nasal breathing if possible (sub-maximal intervals)
- Mouth breathing acceptable at higher intensities
- Rhythmic pattern (avoid erratic breathing)

### During Recovery
- Focus on nasal breathing
- Deep diaphragmatic breaths
- Extend exhale (parasympathetic activation)

### Post-Session
- 2-3 min dedicated breathing
- 4-6 sec inhale, 6-8 sec exhale
- Promotes recovery and nervous system regulation

## Environmental Considerations

### Temperature
- Optimal: 60-70°F (15-21°C)
- Hot environments: Reduce intensity, increase hydration
- Cold environments: Extended warm-up, layer appropriately

### Altitude
- Above 5,000 ft: Reduce intensity by 10-15%
- Acclimatization: 1-2 weeks for full adaptation

### Air Quality
- Check AQI before outdoor sessions
- AQI >100: Indoor training only
- AQI >150: Consider skipping or reducing intensity

## Recovery Between Sessions

### Immediate Post-Session (0-30 min)
- Cool-down walk: 3-5 min
- Hydration: 500ml water + electrolytes
- Light stretching: 5-10 min
- Protein intake: 20-30g within 30-60 min

### Same Day (1-4 hours post)
- Light activity acceptable (walking)
- Avoid heavy cognitive work immediately after (30-60 min recovery)
- Avoid additional intense exercise

### Next Day
- Active recovery acceptable (walking, yoga, swimming)
- Monitor soreness and fatigue
- Adjust next session if needed

## De-load Week Protocol (Every 4th Week)

### Option 1: Reduce Volume
- Keep intensity same
- Reduce rounds by 40%
- Maintain session frequency

### Option 2: Reduce Intensity
- Keep volume same
- Reduce work effort to 80% (RPE 7/10)
- Maintain session frequency

### Option 3: Reduce Frequency
- Keep intensity and volume same
- Reduce to 2 sessions for the week

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Unable to Complete Work Intervals
- **Cause**: Too intense too soon
- **Solution**: Reduce work duration or increase recovery duration

### Issue: Heart Rate Not Elevating
- **Cause**: Insufficient effort or cardiovascular adaptation
- **Solution**: Increase intensity or change modality

### Issue: Excessive Fatigue After Sessions
- **Cause**: Inadequate recovery or too high frequency
- **Solution**: Extend rest days, improve sleep, check nutrition

### Issue: Plateau in Performance
- **Cause**: Adaptation to stimulus
- **Solution**: Change protocol, increase intensity, add variety

### Issue: Negative Impact on Cognitive Performance
- **Cause**: Training too close to cognitive work or overtraining
- **Solution**: Adjust timing, reduce frequency, assess total stress load

## Integration Notes

- HIIT is one component of cognitive performance
- Balance with adequate sleep and nutrition
- Do not increase volume if sleep is compromised
- Scale back during high-stress periods
- Consistency > intensity for long-term cognitive benefits
