# HIIT Training

High-Intensity Interval Training protocols optimized for cognitive enhancement and time efficiency.

## Cognitive Benefits of HIIT

- Increased BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)
- Enhanced cerebral blood flow
- Improved executive function
- Neurogenesis in hippocampus
- Stress resilience
- Mitochondrial biogenesis

## Training Frequency

- **Optimal**: 3-4 sessions per week
- **Minimum**: 2 sessions per week
- **Maximum**: 5 sessions per week (with adequate recovery)
- **Rest**: Minimum 24 hours between sessions
- **De-load week**: Every 4th week reduce volume by 40%

## Session Timing

### Best Times for Cognitive Enhancement
1. **Late morning** (0930-1130): After morning cortisol peak
2. **Late afternoon** (1600-1800): Body temperature peak
3. **Avoid**: First 60 min after waking, within 4 hours of bedtime

### Scheduling Considerations
- Minimum 2 hours post-meal
- Minimum 4 hours before sleep (individual variation applies)
- Not before critical cognitive tasks (acute fatigue)
- Not after heavy cognitive load day (cumulative stress)

## Core Protocols

### Protocol 1: Standard Intervals (Cycling, Running, Rowing)
- Warm-up: 5 min easy pace
- Work intervals: 30-90 sec at 85-95% max HR (RPE 8-9/10)
- Recovery intervals: 2-3x work duration at 60-70% max HR (RPE 3-4/10)
- Repetitions: 4-6 rounds
- Cool-down: 3 min easy pace
- Progression: Add 1 round per week until 6 rounds, then increase work duration

### Protocol 2: Bodyweight Circuit (15 minutes)
- Warm-up: 3 min dynamic movement
- Work: 40 sec, Rest: 20 sec
- Exercises: Burpees, Mountain climbers, Jump squats, Push-ups
- Rounds: 3-4
- Cool-down: 2 min walking
- Progression: Add 1 round or increase work to 45 sec

## Weekly Schedule

Choose 3-4 days per week, with at least 24 hours between sessions. Vary between Protocol 1 (intervals) and Protocol 2 (bodyweight) for balanced training.

## Performance Tracking

Track these essential metrics:
- Heart rate (max during work intervals)
- RPE for work intervals
- Rounds completed
- Session completion date

Review monthly to track improvements and adjust protocols if plateau occurs.

## Heart Rate Zones

Calculate max HR: 220 - age (or 208 - (0.7 × age) for better accuracy)

- **Zone 4-5** (Work): 80-100% max HR
- **Zone 1-2** (Recovery): 50-70% max HR

## Safety and Recovery

### Pre-Session Requirements
- Adequate sleep (minimum 6 hours)
- Hydrated (urine pale yellow)
- No illness or injury
- 2+ hours post-meal

### Skip Session If
- Acute illness or injury
- Sleep <5 hours
- High stress/fatigue

### Post-Session (0-30 min)
- Cool-down: 3-5 min walk
- Hydration: 500ml water + electrolytes
- Protein: 20-30g within 60 min

## De-load Week (Every 4th Week)

Reduce training volume by 40% while maintaining intensity, OR reduce to 2 sessions for the week.

## Key Principles

- Consistency > intensity for long-term cognitive benefits
- Balance with adequate sleep and nutrition
- Scale back during high-stress periods
- Listen to your body and adjust as needed
