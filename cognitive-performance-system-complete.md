# 1. Daily Routines

Structured time blocks designed to maximize cognitive performance throughout the day.

## Morning Protocol (0600-0900)

- **0600-0630**: Wake (consistent ±15 min), 500ml water + electrolytes, bright light exposure, cold shower or light movement
- **0630-0700**: Light cardio (15-20 min, 100-120 bpm)
- **0700-0730**: High-protein breakfast (30-40g protein, complex carbs), caffeine if desired (delay 90-120 min post-wake)
- **0730-0900**: Deep Work Block 1 (90 min, most demanding tasks, no interruptions)

## Midday Protocol (0900-1300)

- **0900-0930**: Review output, plan next block, 5-10 min walk
- **0930-1100**: Deep Work Block 2 (90 min)
- **1100-1130**: Active break (movement, outdoor exposure)
- **1130-1300**: Collaborative work (meetings, communication, lower cognitive load)

## Afternoon Protocol (1300-1800)

- **1300-1400**: Balanced meal, optional 10-20 min walk or NSDR
- **1400-1530**: Deep Work Block 3 (90 min)
- **1530-1600**: Brief walk, hydration, caffeine cutoff
- **1600-1800**: Shallow work (admin, email, planning)

## Evening Protocol (1800-2200)

- **1800-1900**: HIIT or resistance training (if scheduled)
- **1900-2000**: Evening meal (higher carbs for sleep support), complete 2-3 hours before sleep
- **2000-2100**: Wind down (dim lights, low cognitive load, no screens)
- **2100-2130**: Sleep prep (room: 65-68°F, dark, quiet)
- **2130-2200**: In bed by 2200, consistent timing (±30 min)

## Tracking and Adjustment

Track essentials: Wake time, sleep quality (1-10), energy levels (morning/midday/evening), focus quality during deep work

Review weekly: Identify patterns, adjust timing by 15-30 min increments, test changes for 1 week minimum

## Flexibility Guidelines

- **High priority** (maintain consistency): Wake time (±15 min), sleep time (±30 min), morning deep work
- **Medium priority** (±1 hour flexibility): Training time, midday meal
- **Low priority** (adjust as needed): Shallow work timing, break durations

Maximum 3 deep work blocks per day, minimum 10 min break between blocks, batch similar tasks.

# 2. Work and Study Systems

Structured methods for effective learning, productive work, and skill acquisition.

## Deep Work

- **Structure**: 90-min blocks, single task, no distractions
- **Prerequisites**: Clear objective, materials ready, phone away
- **Maximum**: 3 blocks per day
- **Quality metrics**: Time to flow (<10 min), interruptions (target: 0), output, focus quality (1-10)

## Learning: Active Recall

1. **Input**: Read/watch material once without notes (20-40 min)
2. **Process**: Close materials, write what you remember (10 min), identify gaps, re-review gaps
3. **Review**: Same day (evening), next day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month
4. **Test**: Retrieve without prompts, explain aloud, apply to problems, teach others

## Task Management

### Prioritization
- **Tier 1** (Deep Work): Complex problem-solving, creative work → Morning blocks
- **Tier 2** (Collaborative): Meetings, code reviews → Late morning/early afternoon
- **Tier 3** (Shallow): Email, admin → Batch in one 60-90 min block, afternoon

### Planning
- **Daily**: Choose 1-3 Tier 1 tasks, 2-4 Tier 2, batch Tier 3
- **Weekly**: Review completion, identify top 3 priorities, allocate to days, leave 20% buffer

## Focus and Communication

### Environment
- Clear desk, single monitor
- Cool room (68-70°F)
- Bright light during work, dim during breaks
- Silence or non-lyrical music

### Communication
- Check email at fixed times: 1100, 1400, 1630
- 2-minute rule: If <2 min, do immediately
- Batch similar tasks together

## Review and Optimization

- **Weekly** (20 min): What worked? What didn't? One adjustment to test
- **Monthly** (60 min): Review patterns, update systems, plan skill development

# 3. HIIT Training

High-Intensity Interval Training protocols optimized for cognitive enhancement and time efficiency.

## Cognitive Benefits of HIIT

- Increased BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)
- Enhanced cerebral blood flow
- Improved executive function
- Neurogenesis in hippocampus
- Stress resilience
- Mitochondrial biogenesis

## Training Frequency

- **Optimal**: 3-4 sessions per week
- **Minimum**: 2 sessions per week
- **Maximum**: 5 sessions per week (with adequate recovery)
- **Rest**: Minimum 24 hours between sessions
- **De-load week**: Every 4th week reduce volume by 40%

## Session Timing

### Best Times for Cognitive Enhancement
1. **Late morning** (0930-1130): After morning cortisol peak
2. **Late afternoon** (1600-1800): Body temperature peak
3. **Avoid**: First 60 min after waking, within 4 hours of bedtime

### Scheduling Considerations
- Minimum 2 hours post-meal
- Minimum 4 hours before sleep (individual variation applies)
- Not before critical cognitive tasks (acute fatigue)
- Not after heavy cognitive load day (cumulative stress)

## Core Protocols

### Protocol 1: Standard Intervals (Cycling, Running, Rowing)
- Warm-up: 5 min easy pace
- Work intervals: 30-90 sec at 85-95% max HR (RPE 8-9/10)
- Recovery intervals: 2-3x work duration at 60-70% max HR (RPE 3-4/10)
- Repetitions: 4-6 rounds
- Cool-down: 3 min easy pace
- Progression: Add 1 round per week until 6 rounds, then increase work duration

### Protocol 2: Bodyweight Circuit (15 minutes)
- Warm-up: 3 min dynamic movement
- Work: 40 sec, Rest: 20 sec
- Exercises: Burpees, Mountain climbers, Jump squats, Push-ups
- Rounds: 3-4
- Cool-down: 2 min walking
- Progression: Add 1 round or increase work to 45 sec

## Weekly Schedule

Choose 3-4 days per week, with at least 24 hours between sessions. Vary between Protocol 1 (intervals) and Protocol 2 (bodyweight) for balanced training.

## Performance Tracking

Track these essential metrics:
- Heart rate (max during work intervals)
- RPE for work intervals
- Rounds completed
- Session completion date

Review monthly to track improvements and adjust protocols if plateau occurs.

## Heart Rate Zones

Calculate max HR: 220 - age (or 208 - (0.7 × age) for better accuracy)

- **Zone 4-5** (Work): 80-100% max HR
- **Zone 1-2** (Recovery): 50-70% max HR

## Safety and Recovery

### Pre-Session Requirements
- Adequate sleep (minimum 6 hours)
- Hydrated (urine pale yellow)
- No illness or injury
- 2+ hours post-meal

### Skip Session If
- Acute illness or injury
- Sleep <5 hours
- High stress/fatigue

### Post-Session (0-30 min)
- Cool-down: 3-5 min walk
- Hydration: 500ml water + electrolytes
- Protein: 20-30g within 60 min

## De-load Week (Every 4th Week)

Reduce training volume by 40% while maintaining intensity, OR reduce to 2 sessions for the week.

## Key Principles

- Consistency > intensity for long-term cognitive benefits
- Balance with adequate sleep and nutrition
- Scale back during high-stress periods
- Listen to your body and adjust as needed

# 4. Nutrition for Cognition

Evidence-based nutritional strategies to optimize brain function, energy, and cognitive performance.

## Core Principles

1. **Stable blood glucose** - Minimize spikes and crashes
2. **Adequate protein** - Support neurotransmitter production
3. **Quality fats** - Brain structure and function
4. **Micronutrient density** - Cofactors for cognitive processes
5. **Timing optimization** - Align with circadian rhythm and work demands

## Daily Macronutrient Framework

- **Protein**: 1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight (25-40g per meal, 3-4 meals)
- **Fats**: 20-35% of calories (prioritize omega-3: 2-3g/day from fatty fish)

Start one at a time, assess for 2-4 weeks. Quality matters: use third-party tested brands.

## Workout Nutrition

**Pre-workout (2 hours before)**: 20-30g protein, 40-60g carbs, low fat
**Post-workout (within 60 min)**: 20-40g protein, 0.5-1g carbs/kg body weight

## Meal Prep

Batch cook proteins and grains on Sunday (2-3 hours). Portion into containers for easy assembly during the week. Keep backup frozen meals and staples stocked.

## Tracking and Adjustment

Track daily: Energy levels (1-10), cognitive performance, sleep quality, weight (weekly average)

Review weekly to identify patterns. Adjust macros or timing by small increments based on results.

## Key Principles

- Consistency > perfection
- Whole foods > supplements
- Individual variation exists—adjust based on response
- Plan ahead to reduce decision fatigue

# 5. Sleep

Evidence-based protocols for optimizing sleep quality, architecture, and cognitive restoration.

## Sleep Fundamentals

- **Target**: 7-9 hours per night
- **Consistency**: ±30 min window for sleep and wake times
- **Optimal timing**: Sleep 2130-2300, wake 0600-0730 (adjust for individual chronotype)

## Sleep Environment

- **Temperature**: 65-68°F (18-20°C)
- **Darkness**: Complete darkness or <1 lux (blackout curtains or eye mask)
- **Noise**: <30 decibels (white noise machine or earplugs if needed)
- **Bed**: Medium-firm mattress, supportive pillows

## Pre-Sleep Routine (90 min before bed)

- **120 min before**: Dim lights to 50%, last meal complete
- **90 min before**: No screens (or use blue-light blockers), low-cognitive activities
- **60 min before**: Prepare environment (temperature, darkness)
- **30 min before**: In bedroom, read or quiet activity
- **Lights out**: Consistent time (±15 min). If not asleep in 20 min, get up and do quiet activity until sleepy

## Light Exposure

- **Morning** (first 30 min): 10,000 lux or sunlight for 10-30 min
- **Daytime**: Bright environment (500-1000 lux)
- **Evening** (after sunset): Dim to <50%, warm colors, minimize screens
- **Night**: Complete darkness. If needed, red light only (<5 lux)

## Temperature and Substances

### Temperature
- Evening: Hot bath/shower (104-109°F, 10-20 min) 1-2 hours before bed
- Morning: Cold shower to boost alertness

### Substances
- **Caffeine**: Cutoff 8-10 hours before bed (no caffeine after 1400-1500)
- **Alcohol**: Avoid 3-4 hours before bed (fragments sleep, reduces REM)
- **Melatonin**: 0.3-1mg, 30-60 min before bed (for circadian adjustment, not nightly)
- **Magnesium**: 200-400mg, 1-2 hours before bed (glycinate or threonate)

## Sleep Aids

### Breathing for Sleep
- **4-7-8 Breathing**: Inhale 4 sec, hold 7 sec, exhale 8 sec, repeat 4-8x
- **Resonance Breathing**: Inhale 5 sec, exhale 5 sec, 5-10 min

### Other Techniques
- Progressive muscle relaxation: Tense and release muscle groups, start at toes
- Cognitive shuffle: Visualize random non-threatening images (prevents rumination)
- NSDR: Yoga Nidra or body scan (10-30 min afternoon if needed)

## Napping

- **Short nap**: 10-20 min (alertness boost, no grogginess)
- **Long nap**: 90 min (full cycle, creativity boost)
- **Avoid**: 30-60 min naps (causes grogginess)
- **Timing**: Early afternoon (1300-1500), avoid after 1600

## Tracking and Troubleshooting

### Track Daily
- Sleep/wake times, time to fall asleep, awakenings, quality (1-10), morning alertness (1-10)
- Optional: Use wearable (Oura, Whoop, Apple Watch) for trends

### Common Issues
- **Can't fall asleep**: Brain dump worries, use breathing exercises, earlier wind-down, reduce evening cognitive load
- **Night awakenings**: Check temperature/noise/light, limit evening fluids, assess for sleep apnea if persistent
- **Early waking**: Better blackout, consistent temperature, review caffeine intake
- **Non-restorative**: Increase duration by 30 min, reduce alcohol, manage stress

### Consult Provider If
- Chronic issues >3 months despite optimization
- Loud snoring with breathing pauses
- Excessive daytime sleepiness despite adequate duration

## Key Principles

- Sleep is non-negotiable for cognitive performance
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- Protect sleep time in your schedule
- When in doubt, sleep more

# 6. Recovery

Strategic protocols for cognitive and physical restoration to maintain sustained high performance.

## Recovery Fundamentals

### Why Recovery Matters
- Prevents cognitive fatigue accumulation
- Maintains neuroplasticity
- Sustains long-term performance
- Reduces stress response
- Prevents burnout

### Types of Recovery
1. **Immediate**: Minutes to hours post-activity
2. **Short-term**: Day-to-day management
3. **Medium-term**: Weekly cycles
4. **Long-term**: Periodic extended breaks

## Daily Recovery

### Micro-Breaks (Every 90-120 min during work)
- Duration: 5-10 minutes
- Activities: Walk, stretch, deep breathing, eye rest
- Avoid: Switching to another demanding task, social media

### End-of-Day Shutdown (15 min)
1. Review what was accomplished
2. Capture open loops and next steps
3. Physical ritual (pack bag, close computer)
4. Transition walk or activity shift

## Active Recovery

### Light Movement (Daily)
- Walking: 30-60 min total (easy pace)
- Yoga/Stretching: 15-30 min (gentle to moderate)
- Swimming: 20-30 min (easy pace)

### Active Recovery Days (1-2 per week after intense training)
- Replace HIIT with low-intensity cardio: 30-45 min at 60-70% max HR
- Reduce deep work blocks to 1-2 maximum
- More frequent breaks

## Passive Recovery

### Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)
- Yoga Nidra or guided body scan: 10-30 min
- Timing: Afternoon (1300-1500) when fatigued
- Meditation: 10-20 min (breath focus or body scan)

### Optional: Sauna and Cold Exposure
- Sauna: 15-20 min at 170-195°F, 2-4x/week (if available)
- Cold shower: 1-3 min (morning for alertness, post-workout for recovery)
- Note: Not essential, but beneficial if accessible

## Cognitive Recovery

### Nature Exposure
- 20+ minutes daily in natural settings (parks, trails, water)
- Restores attention and reduces mental fatigue

### Novelty and Play
- Hobbies unrelated to work: 30-60 min, 2-3x/week
- Engages different neural circuits, reduces stress

### Social Connection
- Quality social time (meals, activities)
- Stress buffering and emotional support

## Stress Management

### Acute Stress
- **Physiological Sigh**: Double inhale (nose), extended exhale (mouth), 1-3 cycles
- **Box Breathing**: 4-sec inhale, 4-sec hold, 4-sec exhale, 4-sec hold, repeat 5-10x

### Chronic Stress
Assess total load (work, training, sleep, life events) and reduce through prioritization, boundaries, and scheduling buffer time.

## Recovery Foundations

Most critical recovery factors (in priority order):
1. **Sleep**: 7-9 hours, consistent timing
2. **Nutrition**: Adequate protein, calories, hydration
3. **Stress Management**: Address chronic stress
4. **Active Recovery**: Movement and light exercise
5. **Passive Recovery**: NSDR, meditation (optional: sauna, cold exposure)

## Key Principles

- Schedule recovery proactively, not reactively
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- Adjust based on how you feel and perform
- Recovery is training, not laziness
