# Sleep

Evidence-based protocols for optimizing sleep quality, architecture, and cognitive restoration.

## Sleep Fundamentals

### Target Duration
- **Optimal**: 7-9 hours per night
- **Minimum**: 7 hours (chronic <7 hours impairs cognition)
- **Individual variation**: Some need 7, others need 9
- **Assessment**: Track subjective quality + cognitive performance

### Sleep Architecture
- **NREM Stage 1**: Transition (5% of sleep)
- **NREM Stage 2**: Light sleep (45-55% of sleep)
- **NREM Stage 3**: Deep sleep (15-25% of sleep) - Physical restoration, memory consolidation
- **REM**: Rapid Eye Movement (20-25% of sleep) - Emotional processing, creativity, learning

### Circadian Timing
- **Consistency**: ±30 min window for sleep and wake times
- **Optimal sleep onset**: 2130-2300 for most
- **Optimal wake time**: 0600-0730 for most
- **Individual chronotype**: May vary (earlier or later)

## Sleep Hygiene Protocol

### Environment Setup

#### Temperature
- **Optimal**: 65-68°F (18-20°C)
- **Mechanism**: Facilitates core body temperature drop needed for sleep onset
- **Tools**: Thermostat, fan, cooling mattress pad

#### Darkness
- **Target**: Complete darkness or <1 lux
- **Tools**: Blackout curtains, eye mask, remove LED lights
- **Wavelength**: Eliminate blue/green light especially

#### Noise
- **Ideal**: <30 decibels
- **Options**: 
  - White noise machine (consistent 40-50 dB)
  - Earplugs (if environment noisy)
  - Pink noise (some prefer for sleep depth)
- **Avoid**: Variable or unpredictable sounds

#### Bed Quality
- **Mattress**: Replace every 7-10 years, medium-firm generally optimal
- **Pillows**: Support neutral spine alignment
- **Bedding**: Breathable materials (cotton, linen)

### Pre-Sleep Routine (90-120 min before bed)

#### 120 Minutes Before (2000)
- Dim lights to 50% or less
- Shift to warmer color temperature (<3000K)
- Put on blue-light blocking glasses (optional but helpful)
- Last meal complete

#### 90 Minutes Before (2030)
- No more screens (phone, computer, TV) - if necessary, use blue blockers
- Transition to low-cognitive-load activities
- Light reading, stretching, conversation
- Avoid: Work, financial planning, conflict, stimulating content

#### 60 Minutes Before (2100)
- Prepare environment (temperature, darkness)
- Personal hygiene (shower can be part of routine)
- Gratitude or reflection (3-5 min written or mental)

#### 30 Minutes Before (2130)
- In bedroom
- Read physical book (non-stimulating) or listen to quiet music
- Breathing exercises (optional)
- Journal any persistent thoughts (brain dump)

#### Lights Out (2200)
- Consistent time (±15 min)
- All lights off
- Phone in another room or in airplane mode
- If not asleep in 20 min, get up and do quiet activity until sleepy

## Light Exposure Protocol

### Morning (First 30 min after waking)
- **Bright light exposure**: 10,000 lux or sunlight
- **Duration**: 10-30 minutes
- **Purpose**: Set circadian clock, promote alertness
- **Options**: 
  - Outdoor morning walk (best)
  - Light therapy box (10,000 lux)
  - Bright indoor lights (>1000 lux)

### Daytime
- **Bright environment**: 500-1000 lux during work
- **Outdoor time**: 30-60 min total throughout day
- **Purpose**: Maintain alertness, strengthen circadian rhythm

### Evening (After sunset)
- **Dim lights**: Reduce to <50% brightness
- **Warm colors**: Shift to amber/red wavelengths
- **Blue light reduction**: 
  - Software (f.lux, Night Shift) on devices
  - Blue-blocking glasses (amber lenses)
  - Minimize screen time

### Night
- **Complete darkness**: 0 lux
- **Red light only**: If light needed (bathroom), use red <5 lux
- **No phone checking**: Avoid light exposure during night

## Temperature Manipulation

### Evening Temperature Drop
- **Hot bath/shower**: 1-2 hours before bed
- **Mechanism**: Warm surface → heat dissipation → core cooling
- **Temperature**: 104-109°F (40-43°C)
- **Duration**: 10-20 minutes

### Morning Temperature Increase
- **Cold shower**: Upon waking or after light movement
- **Mechanism**: Increase core temperature, boost alertness
- **Temperature**: Cool to cold
- **Duration**: 1-3 minutes

### Sleep Environment
- **Room cool**: 65-68°F consistently
- **Feet warm**: Socks acceptable (promotes heat dissipation from extremities)

## Substances and Sleep

### Caffeine
- **Half-life**: 5-6 hours (quarter-life: 10-12 hours)
- **Cutoff**: 8-10 hours before bed (for most: no caffeine after 1400-1500)
- **Individual variation**: Some metabolize faster/slower
- **Impact**: Reduces deep sleep even if you fall asleep

### Alcohol
- **Effect**: Sedation ≠ sleep
- **Impact**: Fragments sleep, reduces REM, increases awakenings
- **Recommendation**: Avoid 3-4 hours before bed, limit frequency
- **If consuming**: Earlier in evening, lower quantity

### Melatonin
- **Dose**: 0.3-1mg (most supplements are overdosed at 3-10mg)
- **Timing**: 30-60 min before bed
- **Use case**: Jet lag, shift work, circadian adjustment
- **Not for**: Nightly use without purpose (can downregulate production)

### Magnesium
- **Dose**: 200-400mg
- **Form**: Glycinate or threonate (better absorption, calming)
- **Timing**: 1-2 hours before bed
- **Mechanism**: GABA activation, muscle relaxation

### THC/CBD
- **THC**: May help onset but reduces REM sleep
- **CBD**: May help anxiety, minimal sleep architecture impact
- **Note**: Use cautiously, not as primary sleep aid

### Sleep Medications
- **Avoid if possible**: Can impair natural sleep architecture
- **If necessary**: Lowest effective dose, short-term use
- **Consult**: Healthcare provider for chronic sleep issues

## Sleep Optimization Techniques

### Breathing for Sleep Onset

#### 4-7-8 Breathing
- Inhale through nose: 4 seconds
- Hold: 7 seconds
- Exhale through mouth: 8 seconds
- Repeat: 4-8 cycles
- Effect: Activates parasympathetic nervous system

#### Resonance Breathing
- Inhale: 5 seconds
- Exhale: 5 seconds
- Duration: 5-10 minutes
- Effect: Autonomic balance, reduced arousal

### Progressive Muscle Relaxation
- Systematically tense and release muscle groups
- Start: Toes, progress to head
- Tense: 5 seconds, Release: 10 seconds
- Duration: 10-15 minutes
- Effect: Physical and mental relaxation

### Cognitive Shuffle
- Visualize random, non-threatening images
- Switch every 5-10 seconds
- Examples: Apple, beach, bicycle, cloud
- Effect: Prevents rumination, engages visual cortex away from verbal thought

### Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)
- Yoga Nidra or guided body scan
- Duration: 10-30 minutes
- Timing: Afternoon if needed, or in place of nap
- Effect: Restores neural resources, can compensate for some sleep loss

## Napping Guidelines

### Optimal Nap Duration
- **Short nap**: 10-20 min (avoid sleep inertia, boosts alertness)
- **Long nap**: 90 min (full sleep cycle, creativity boost)
- **Avoid**: 30-60 min (wakes during deep sleep, causes grogginess)

### Timing
- **Optimal**: Early afternoon (1300-1500)
- **Avoid**: After 1600 (interferes with night sleep)
- **Circadian dip**: Natural dip in alertness post-lunch

### Frequency
- **If needed**: 1 nap per day
- **Not replacement**: For insufficient night sleep

## Sleep Tracking

### Subjective Metrics (Daily)
- Sleep onset time
- Wake time
- Estimated time to fall asleep
- Number of awakenings
- Subjective quality (1-10 scale)
- Morning alertness (1-10 scale)

### Objective Metrics (Optional)
- **Wearable devices**: Track sleep stages, heart rate, HRV
- **Accuracy**: Not perfect but useful for trends
- **Recommended**: Oura Ring, Whoop, Apple Watch
- **Focus**: Trends over time, not single nights

### Key Patterns to Identify
- Relationship between sleep timing and quality
- Impact of exercise timing on sleep
- Effect of meal timing
- Caffeine cutoff effectiveness
- Environmental factors (temperature, noise)

## Troubleshooting Sleep Issues

### Difficulty Falling Asleep

#### Cognitive Hyperarousal
- **Symptoms**: Racing thoughts, worry
- **Solutions**:
  - Brain dump before bed (write concerns)
  - Cognitive shuffle technique
  - Earlier wind-down routine start
  - Reduce cognitive load in evening

#### Physiological Hyperarousal
- **Symptoms**: Elevated heart rate, tension
- **Solutions**:
  - Breathing exercises (4-7-8)
  - Progressive muscle relaxation
  - Earlier exercise cutoff
  - Reduce caffeine or earlier cutoff

### Frequent Night Awakenings

#### Environmental Factors
- Check temperature, noise, light
- Adjust room conditions
- Better blackout curtains or eye mask

#### Physiological Factors
- Avoid large evening meals
- Limit fluid intake 2 hours before bed
- Check for sleep apnea if persistent (consult doctor)
- Manage stress and anxiety

### Early Morning Awakening

#### Possible Causes
- Too much light in room
- Room temperature rising
- Caffeine sensitivity
- Stress/anxiety
- Advanced sleep phase (chronotype)

#### Solutions
- Better blackout setup
- Consistent temperature
- Review caffeine intake
- Stress management techniques
- Adjust sleep timing if chronotype issue

### Non-Restorative Sleep

#### Assess Sleep Quality
- Are you getting enough deep and REM sleep?
- Sleep fragmentation (too many awakenings)?
- Sleep apnea screening (if snoring, gasping)

#### Optimize Sleep Factors
- Review all sleep hygiene factors
- Increase sleep duration by 30 min
- Reduce alcohol, improve nutrition
- Manage stress

## Sleep and Cognitive Performance

### Impact of Sleep Deprivation
- **Attention**: Declines significantly after 1 night
- **Working memory**: Impaired with chronic restriction
- **Emotional regulation**: Reduced with <7 hours
- **Decision-making**: Risk assessment impaired
- **Learning**: Memory consolidation reduced

### Sleep for Learning
- **Pre-learning**: Adequate sleep prepares brain for encoding
- **Post-learning**: Sleep consolidates memories
- **Timing**: Sleep within 24 hours of learning optimal
- **Stages**: Deep sleep for declarative memory, REM for procedural

### Recovery from Sleep Debt
- **Acute**: 1-2 recovery nights with extra 1-2 hours
- **Chronic**: Requires 2-4 weeks of consistent optimal sleep
- **Full recovery**: May take longer for severe chronic restriction

## Shift Work and Irregular Schedules

### Night Shift Adaptation
- Maintain consistent sleep schedule on work nights
- Dark environment for day sleep (blackout essential)
- Bright light during work night shift
- Melatonin for circadian adjustment (consult timing)

### Rotating Shifts
- Rotate forward if possible (day → evening → night)
- Allow 48 hours for adjustment between rotations
- Prioritize sleep duration over perfection

### Travel and Jet Lag
- Adjust sleep schedule 1 hour per day before travel (if 3+ hour change)
- Upon arrival: Bright light at local morning, darkness at local night
- Melatonin: 0.5-1mg at local bedtime for first 2-3 nights
- Exercise at local daytime

## Weekly Sleep Review

### What to Assess (Every Sunday)
- Average sleep duration
- Consistency of timing
- Sleep quality ratings
- Morning alertness ratings
- Correlation with performance (cognitive tasks, workouts)

### Adjustments to Test
- Sleep timing (15-30 min earlier/later)
- Wind-down routine modifications
- Environmental changes
- Supplement timing or dose
- Caffeine cutoff time

### Long-Term Tracking
- Monthly averages
- Identify seasonal patterns
- Correlate with life events, stress, training load

## Sleep as Foundation

- Sleep is non-negotiable for cognitive performance
- Prioritize over almost everything else
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- Protect sleep time in your schedule
- All other system components depend on adequate sleep
- When in doubt, sleep more

## Red Flags (Consult Healthcare Provider)

- Chronic difficulty falling asleep (>30 min, most nights)
- Frequent night awakenings (>3 per night)
- Loud snoring with breathing pauses
- Excessive daytime sleepiness despite adequate duration
- Restless legs or movement during sleep
- Sleep issues lasting >3 months despite optimization attempts
