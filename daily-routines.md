# Daily Routines

Structured time blocks designed to maximize cognitive performance throughout the day.

## Morning Protocol (0600-0900)

### 0600-0630: Wake and Hydration
- Wake at consistent time (±15 min window)
- 500ml water + electrolytes
- Exposure to bright light (natural or 10,000 lux lamp)
- Body temperature increase (cold shower or light movement)

### 0630-0700: Movement
- Light cardiovascular activity (walking, cycling)
- 15-20 minutes
- Heart rate: 100-120 bpm
- Purpose: cortisol optimization, alertness

### 0700-0730: First Nutrition Window
- High-protein breakfast (30-40g protein)
- Complex carbohydrates
- Caffeine: 100-200mg (if tolerance allows)
- Delay: 90-120 min post-wake for optimal cortisol curve

### 0730-0900: Deep Work Block 1
- Most cognitively demanding tasks
- No interruptions
- Phone in another room
- 90-minute focus session

## Midday Protocol (0900-1300)

### 0900-0930: Transition and Planning
- Review morning output
- Plan next work block
- Brief movement break (5-10 min walk)

### 0930-1100: Deep Work Block 2
- Complex problem-solving
- Creative work
- 90-minute focus session

### 1100-1130: Active Break
- Physical movement
- Outdoor exposure preferred
- Social interaction optional

### 1130-1300: Collaborative Work
- Meetings
- Communication tasks
- Lower cognitive load activities

## Afternoon Protocol (1300-1800)

### 1300-1400: Midday Nutrition and Rest
- Balanced meal (protein, fats, complex carbs)
- Optional: 10-20 minute non-sleep deep rest (NSDR) or walk
- Avoid: high glycemic foods, large portions

### 1400-1530: Deep Work Block 3
- Analytical tasks
- Implementation work
- 90-minute focus session

### 1530-1600: Break and Movement
- Brief walk or light exercise
- Hydration check
- Caffeine cutoff (if sleep sensitive)

### 1600-1800: Shallow Work
- Administrative tasks
- Email and communication
- Planning for next day
- Lower stakes activities

## Evening Protocol (1800-2200)

### 1800-1900: Training Window (if scheduled)
- HIIT or resistance training
- Complete by 1900 to allow recovery before sleep

### 1900-2000: Evening Nutrition
- Moderate portion
- Higher carbohydrate relative to day (supports sleep)
- Complete 2-3 hours before sleep

### 2000-2100: Wind Down
- Reduce light exposure (dim lights, amber glasses)
- Low cognitive load activities
- Social time or light reading
- Avoid: screens, stimulating content

### 2100-2130: Sleep Preparation
- Room temperature: 65-68°F (18-20°C)
- Room darkening
- White noise or silence
- Consistent pre-sleep routine

### 2130-2200: Sleep Window Begins
- In bed by 2200
- 8-9 hours sleep opportunity
- Consistent timing (±30 min)

## Key Variables to Track

- Wake time
- Sleep quality (subjective 1-10)
- Energy levels (morning, midday, evening)
- Focus quality during deep work blocks
- Caffeine timing and amount
- Exercise completion
- Nutrition timing

## Adjustment Protocol

### Weekly Review
- Compare tracked variables
- Identify patterns (sleep, energy, performance)
- Adjust timing by 15-30 min increments
- Test changes for minimum 1 week

### Quarterly Optimization
- Review 12 weeks of data
- Major schedule adjustments if needed
- Integrate seasonal changes (light exposure)
- Update work block allocations based on role changes

## Flexibility Guidelines

### High Priority (maintain consistency)
- Wake time (±15 min)
- Sleep time (±30 min)
- Deep work block 1 (morning)

### Medium Priority (±1 hour flexibility)
- Training time
- Midday nutrition

### Low Priority (adjust as needed)
- Shallow work timing
- Break durations
- Social time allocation

## Context Switching Rules

- Maximum 3 deep work blocks per day
- Minimum 10 min break between blocks
- No context switches during deep work
- Batch similar tasks (communication, admin)
- Schedule buffer time for unexpected items (30 min/day)
