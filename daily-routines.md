# Daily Routines

Structured time blocks designed to maximize cognitive performance throughout the day.

## Morning Protocol (0600-0900)

- **0600-0630**: Wake (consistent ±15 min), 500ml water + electrolytes, bright light exposure, cold shower or light movement
- **0630-0700**: Light cardio (15-20 min, 100-120 bpm)
- **0700-0730**: High-protein breakfast (30-40g protein, complex carbs), caffeine if desired (delay 90-120 min post-wake)
- **0730-0900**: Deep Work Block 1 (90 min, most demanding tasks, no interruptions)

## Midday Protocol (0900-1300)

- **0900-0930**: Review output, plan next block, 5-10 min walk
- **0930-1100**: Deep Work Block 2 (90 min)
- **1100-1130**: Active break (movement, outdoor exposure)
- **1130-1300**: Collaborative work (meetings, communication, lower cognitive load)

## Afternoon Protocol (1300-1800)

- **1300-1400**: Balanced meal, optional 10-20 min walk or NSDR
- **1400-1530**: Deep Work Block 3 (90 min)
- **1530-1600**: Brief walk, hydration, caffeine cutoff
- **1600-1800**: Shallow work (admin, email, planning)

## Evening Protocol (1800-2200)

- **1800-1900**: HIIT or resistance training (if scheduled)
- **1900-2000**: Evening meal (higher carbs for sleep support), complete 2-3 hours before sleep
- **2000-2100**: Wind down (dim lights, low cognitive load, no screens)
- **2100-2130**: Sleep prep (room: 65-68°F, dark, quiet)
- **2130-2200**: In bed by 2200, consistent timing (±30 min)

## Tracking and Adjustment

Track essentials: Wake time, sleep quality (1-10), energy levels (morning/midday/evening), focus quality during deep work

Review weekly: Identify patterns, adjust timing by 15-30 min increments, test changes for 1 week minimum

## Flexibility Guidelines

- **High priority** (maintain consistency): Wake time (±15 min), sleep time (±30 min), morning deep work
- **Medium priority** (±1 hour flexibility): Training time, midday meal
- **Low priority** (adjust as needed): Shallow work timing, break durations

Maximum 3 deep work blocks per day, minimum 10 min break between blocks, batch similar tasks.
