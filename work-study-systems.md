# Work and Study Systems

Structured methods for effective learning, productive work, and skill acquisition.

## Deep Work

- **Structure**: 90-min blocks, single task, no distractions
- **Prerequisites**: Clear objective, materials ready, phone away
- **Maximum**: 3 blocks per day
- **Quality metrics**: Time to flow (<10 min), interruptions (target: 0), output, focus quality (1-10)

## Learning: Active Recall

1. **Input**: Read/watch material once without notes (20-40 min)
2. **Process**: Close materials, write what you remember (10 min), identify gaps, re-review gaps
3. **Review**: Same day (evening), next day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month
4. **Test**: Retrieve without prompts, explain aloud, apply to problems, teach others

## Task Management

### Prioritization
- **Tier 1** (Deep Work): Complex problem-solving, creative work → Morning blocks
- **Tier 2** (Collaborative): Meetings, code reviews → Late morning/early afternoon
- **Tier 3** (Shallow): Email, admin → Batch in one 60-90 min block, afternoon

### Planning
- **Daily**: Choose 1-3 Tier 1 tasks, 2-4 Tier 2, batch Tier 3
- **Weekly**: Review completion, identify top 3 priorities, allocate to days, leave 20% buffer

## Focus and Communication

### Environment
- Clear desk, single monitor
- Cool room (68-70°F)
- Bright light during work, dim during breaks
- Silence or non-lyrical music

### Communication
- Check email at fixed times: 1100, 1400, 1630
- 2-minute rule: If <2 min, do immediately
- Batch similar tasks together

## Review and Optimization

- **Weekly** (20 min): What worked? What didn't? One adjustment to test
- **Monthly** (60 min): Review patterns, update systems, plan skill development
