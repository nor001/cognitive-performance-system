# Work and Study Systems

Structured methods for effective learning, productive work, and skill acquisition.

## Deep Work Protocol

### Prerequisites
- 90-minute uninterrupted block
- Eliminate all distractions (phone, notifications, other people)
- Clear objective for the session
- Required materials prepared
- Hydration available

### Execution
1. **Start ritual** (2 min): Note start time, write objective
2. **Work period** (90 min): Single task, no switching
3. **End ritual** (3 min): Note completion, capture next steps

### Quality Metrics
- Time to reach flow state (<10 min optimal)
- Number of interruptions (target: 0)
- Output produced (task-dependent metric)
- Subjective focus quality (1-10 scale)

## Learning System: Active Recall Protocol

### Input Phase
- Read/watch material once without note-taking
- Duration: Based on content (typically 20-40 min)
- Goal: Exposure and comprehension

### Processing Phase
- Close materials
- Write what you remember (10 min)
- Identify gaps in understanding
- Re-review only the gaps
- Create questions from material

### Consolidation Phase
- Spaced repetition schedule:
  - Review 1: Same day (evening)
  - Review 2: Next day
  - Review 3: 3 days later
  - Review 4: 1 week later
  - Review 5: 2 weeks later
  - Review 6: 1 month later

### Testing Phase
- Retrieve without prompts
- Explain concepts out loud or in writing
- Apply to novel problems
- Teach to someone else (real or imagined)

## Note-Taking Framework: Zettelkasten-Style

### Structure
```
/notes
  /permanent
    - Atomic notes (one concept per note)
    - ID system: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
    - Linked to related concepts
  /literature
    - Source material notes
    - Citations and references
  /project
    - Temporary project-based notes
    - Archived when project completes
```

### Note Creation Process
1. Capture idea/concept in own words
2. Assign unique ID
3. Link to related notes (minimum 2 connections)
4. Add tags (maximum 3-5)
5. Write brief summary (1-2 sentences)

### Review Cycle
- Daily: Process captured items (5-10 min)
- Weekly: Review and strengthen connections (20-30 min)
- Monthly: Identify clusters and patterns (30-60 min)

## Task Management System

### Capture
- Single inbox for all inputs
- Capture immediately (external memory)
- Process daily

### Prioritization Matrix

#### Tier 1: Deep Work (High Cognitive Load)
- Complex problem-solving
- Creative work
- Strategic planning
- Schedule: Morning deep work blocks

#### Tier 2: Collaborative Work (Medium Cognitive Load)
- Meetings with agenda
- Pair programming
- Code reviews
- Schedule: Late morning to early afternoon

#### Tier 3: Shallow Work (Low Cognitive Load)
- Email responses
- Administrative tasks
- Routine maintenance
- Schedule: Afternoon or between deep work blocks

### Daily Task Selection
- Choose 1-3 Tier 1 tasks (morning)
- Choose 2-4 Tier 2 tasks (midday)
- Batch all Tier 3 tasks (one 60-90 min block)

### Weekly Planning
- Sunday evening or Monday morning
- Review previous week's completion
- Identify top 3 priorities for week
- Allocate to specific days
- Leave 20% buffer for unexpected

## Focus Enhancement Techniques

### Pomodoro Variation (for medium-complexity tasks)
- 50 min work : 10 min break
- After 2 cycles: 20 min break
- Maximum 4 cycles per day

### Ultradian Rhythm Optimization
- Natural 90-120 min cycles
- Work with, not against, energy levels
- Take breaks during low-energy transitions

### Environment Design
- **Visual**: Clear desk, single monitor view
- **Auditory**: Silence or non-lyrical music (40 Hz binaural beats optional)
- **Temperature**: Cool (68-70°F / 20-21°C)
- **Light**: Bright during work (500+ lux), dim during breaks

## Reading System

### Technical Reading
- Pre-read: Table of contents, conclusion, diagrams (5 min)
- Active read: One section at a time with notes (20-30 min)
- Post-read: Summarize in own words (5 min)
- Review: Spaced repetition schedule

### Research Paper Protocol
1. Read abstract and conclusion (3 min)
2. Examine figures and tables (5 min)
3. Read introduction and discussion (10 min)
4. Read methods and results if needed (15 min)
5. Create synthesis note (5 min)

### Information Filtering
- Apply 80/20 rule: Focus on 20% with highest value
- Skip: Redundant explanations, excessive examples
- Extract: Core concepts, actionable insights, novel ideas

## Writing System

### Drafting Process
1. **Brain dump** (15 min): Write without editing
2. **Structure** (10 min): Organize into sections
3. **Expand** (30 min): Flesh out each section
4. **Edit** (20 min): Clarity and conciseness
5. **Final pass** (10 min): Grammar and flow

### Writing Schedule
- First drafts: Morning deep work blocks
- Editing: Afternoon (lower cognitive load)
- Final review: Next day (fresh perspective)

## Meeting Protocol

### Pre-Meeting
- Clear agenda shared 24h in advance
- Expected outcomes defined
- Preparation time allocated
- Duration limited (30 or 60 min, no exceptions)

### During Meeting
- Start on time (regardless of attendance)
- One topic at a time
- Document decisions and action items
- End on time (or early)

### Post-Meeting
- Send action items within 1 hour
- Calendar block for follow-up tasks
- No need to review meeting unless decisions changed

## Communication Batching

### Email/Messages
- Check at fixed times: 1100, 1400, 1630
- Response window: 24 hours for non-urgent
- 2-minute rule: If takes <2 min, do immediately
- Template responses for common requests

### Async Communication Preference
- Default to async (email, documents)
- Sync only when needed (complex discussion, negotiation)
- Record sync decisions in async format

## Project Management

### Project Initiation
1. Define success criteria (specific, measurable)
2. Break into phases (max 2-week iterations)
3. Identify dependencies
4. Allocate time blocks
5. Set review checkpoints

### Progress Tracking
- Daily: 5 min review (am or pm)
- Weekly: 20 min progress check
- Milestone: Retrospective and adjust

### Completion Criteria
- Deliverable meets success criteria
- Documentation complete
- Knowledge captured (lessons learned)
- Next steps identified

## Cognitive Load Management

### Reducing Extraneous Load
- Consistent systems and routines
- Templates for recurring tasks
- Automated processes where possible
- External memory (notes, task list)

### Managing Intrinsic Load
- Break complex tasks into sub-tasks
- Build mental models before implementation
- Use visual aids (diagrams, flowcharts)
- Work at optimal difficulty (challenge ≈ skill level)

### Increasing Germane Load
- Focus on understanding, not memorizing
- Make connections to existing knowledge
- Apply concepts in varied contexts
- Practice retrieval

## Iteration and Optimization

### Weekly Review (20 min)
- What worked well?
- What didn't work?
- What to change?
- One adjustment to test next week

### Monthly Review (60 min)
- Review 4 weeks of weekly reviews
- Identify patterns
- Update systems/protocols
- Plan skill development focus

### Quarterly Review (2 hours)
- Major system overhaul if needed
- Skill assessment and gap analysis
- Update learning roadmap
- Adjust work allocation based on goals
