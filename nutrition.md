# Nutrition for Cognition

Evidence-based nutritional strategies to optimize brain function, energy, and cognitive performance.

## Core Principles

1. **Stable blood glucose** - Minimize spikes and crashes
2. **Adequate protein** - Support neurotransmitter production
3. **Quality fats** - Brain structure and function
4. **Micronutrient density** - Cofactors for cognitive processes
5. **Timing optimization** - Align with circadian rhythm and work demands

## Daily Macronutrient Framework

- **Protein**: 1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight (25-40g per meal, 3-4 meals)
- **Fats**: 20-35% of calories (prioritize omega-3: 2-3g/day from fatty fish)
- **Carbohydrates**: 40-50% of calories (complex, low-glycemic sources)

## Meal Timing

### Morning (0700-0800)
- Protein: 30-40g | Carbs: 40-60g | Fats: 15-20g
- Example: 3 eggs with vegetables, 1 cup oats with berries

### Midday (1200-1300)
- Protein: 30-40g | Carbs: 50-70g | Fats: 15-25g
- Example: 150g chicken/fish, 1 cup rice/quinoa, large salad

### Evening (1900-2000)
- Protein: 30-40g | Carbs: 60-100g | Fats: 15-20g
- Example: 150g salmon, 1.5 cups sweet potato, vegetables
- Complete 2-3 hours before sleep

## Key Micronutrients

- **B Vitamins**: Meat, fish, eggs, leafy greens (target RDA)
- **Magnesium**: Spinach, nuts, dark chocolate (400-500mg/day)
- **Vitamin D**: Sunlight, fatty fish, fortified foods (2,000-4,000 IU/day)
- **Choline**: Eggs, salmon (2-3 whole eggs daily optimal)

## Hydration

- **Daily target**: 3L (males), 2.2L (females) + 500ml on active days
- **Upon waking**: 500ml water + electrolytes
- **Throughout day**: 200ml every 1-2 hours
- **Evening**: Reduce 2 hours before bed

## Priority Foods

**Daily**: Fatty fish, eggs (2-3/day), blueberries, leafy greens, nuts, olive oil
**Often**: Avocados, dark chocolate (85%+), green tea, turmeric
**Limit**: High-glycemic carbs, trans fats, excess sugar, alcohol (max 1-2 drinks/week)

## Caffeine Strategy

- **Timing**: 90-120 min after waking, cutoff 8-10 hours before sleep (typically no caffeine after 1400-1500)
- **Dosing**: 100-200mg per dose, maximum 400mg daily
- **Sources**: Coffee (100mg/cup), green tea (30-50mg/cup + L-theanine)
- **Optional cycling**: 5 days on, 2 days off to maintain sensitivity

## Supplements

### Essential (High Evidence)
1. **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)**: 2-3g/day
2. **Creatine**: 5g/day
3. **Vitamin D3**: 2,000-4,000 IU/day (if deficient)
4. **Magnesium**: 200-400mg/day (glycinate or threonate)

### Optional (Moderate Evidence)
- L-Theanine: 100-200mg with caffeine
- Rhodiola Rosea: 200-400mg/day (adaptogen)

Start one at a time, assess for 2-4 weeks. Quality matters: use third-party tested brands.

## Workout Nutrition

**Pre-workout (2 hours before)**: 20-30g protein, 40-60g carbs, low fat
**Post-workout (within 60 min)**: 20-40g protein, 0.5-1g carbs/kg body weight

## Meal Prep

Batch cook proteins and grains on Sunday (2-3 hours). Portion into containers for easy assembly during the week. Keep backup frozen meals and staples stocked.

## Tracking and Adjustment

Track daily: Energy levels (1-10), cognitive performance, sleep quality, weight (weekly average)

Review weekly to identify patterns. Adjust macros or timing by small increments based on results.

## Key Principles

- Consistency > perfection
- Whole foods > supplements
- Individual variation exists—adjust based on response
- Plan ahead to reduce decision fatigue
