# Nutrition for Cognition

Evidence-based nutritional strategies to optimize brain function, energy, and cognitive performance.

## Core Principles

1. **Stable blood glucose** - Minimize spikes and crashes
2. **Adequate protein** - Support neurotransmitter production
3. **Quality fats** - Brain structure and function
4. **Micronutrient density** - Cofactors for cognitive processes
5. **Timing optimization** - Align with circadian rhythm and work demands

## Daily Macronutrient Framework

### Protein: 1.6-2.2 g/kg body weight
- **Morning emphasis**: 30-40g at first meal
- **Distribution**: 25-40g per meal, 3-4 meals
- **Sources**: Eggs, fish, poultry, lean meat, Greek yogurt, legumes
- **Function**: Neurotransmitter precursors (dopamine, serotonin)

### Fats: 20-35% of total calories
- **Omega-3 EPA/DHA**: 2-3g per day
- **Sources**: Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines), fish oil, algae oil
- **Additional**: Olive oil, avocados, nuts, seeds
- **Function**: Membrane integrity, anti-inflammatory

### Carbohydrates: Remaining calories (typically 40-50%)
- **Type**: Complex, low-glycemic
- **Sources**: Oats, quinoa, sweet potato, brown rice, vegetables, fruits
- **Timing**: Moderate morning/lunch, higher evening (sleep support)
- **Function**: Glucose supply, sleep facilitation

## Meal Timing Protocol

- **Test**: Check 25(OH)D levels annually

### Choline (Memory, acetylcholine synthesis)
- **Sources**: Eggs, liver, salmon, broccoli
- **Target**: 400-550mg/day
- **Optimal**: 2-3 whole eggs daily

## Hydration Protocol

### Daily Target
- **Minimum**: 3 liters (100 oz) for males, 2.2 liters (75 oz) for females
- **Active days**: Add 500-1000ml
- **Indicator**: Urine pale yellow

### Timing Strategy
- **Upon waking**: 500ml water + electrolytes
- **Morning**: 500ml by 1000
- **Throughout day**: 200ml every 1-2 hours
- **With meals**: 250-500ml
- **Pre-workout**: 500ml (1-2 hours before)
- **Post-workout**: 500ml + electrolytes
- **Evening taper**: Reduce 2 hours before bed (minimize sleep disruption)

### Electrolyte Considerations
- **Sodium**: 3-5g/day (adjust for activity and sweat rate)
- **Potassium**: 3-5g/day (fruits, vegetables, potatoes)
- **Add electrolytes**: Morning water, post-workout, during extended cognitive work

## Cognitive-Enhancing Foods

### High Priority (Daily)
1. **Fatty fish** (salmon, sardines, mackerel): 2-3 servings/week minimum
2. **Eggs** (whole): 2-3 per day
3. **Blueberries**: 1 cup per day (fresh or frozen)
4. **Leafy greens** (spinach, kale): 2+ cups per day
5. **Nuts** (walnuts, almonds): 1-2 oz per day
6. **Olive oil** (extra virgin): 2-3 tbsp per day

### Medium Priority (3-5x per week)
1. **Avocados**: Rich in monounsaturated fats
2. **Dark chocolate** (85%+ cacao): 20-40g
3. **Green tea**: 2-3 cups (L-theanine + caffeine)
4. **Beets**: Nitrates for blood flow
5. **Turmeric**: Curcumin (with black pepper for absorption)

### Beneficial (As desired)
1. **Broccoli**: Vitamin K, antioxidants
2. **Pumpkin seeds**: Zinc, magnesium
3. **Oranges**: Vitamin C

## Foods to Limit or Avoid

### High Priority to Avoid
- **High-glycemic carbs**: White bread, sugary cereals, pastries (blood glucose spikes)
- **Trans fats**: Fried foods, processed snacks (inflammation)
- **Excess sugar**: Sodas, candy, sweetened beverages (cognitive impairment)
- **Alcohol**: Limit to 1-2 drinks per week maximum (neurotoxic, sleep disruption)

### Moderate Consumption
- **Processed meats**: Occasional, not daily
- **High-mercury fish**: Limit tuna, swordfish to 1x per week
- **Refined grains**: Use sparingly, opt for whole grains

## Caffeine Strategy

### Timing
- **First dose**: 90-120 min after waking (avoid adenosine receptor interference during cortisol peak)
- **Typical window**: 0800-0900
- **Cutoff**: 8-10 hours before sleep (individual variation)
- **For most**: No caffeine after 1400-1500

### Dosing
- **Optimal**: 100-200mg per dose
- **Maximum daily**: 400mg (for most individuals)
- **Frequency**: 1-2 doses per day

### Sources
- **Coffee**: 100mg per cup (variable)
- **Green tea**: 30-50mg per cup (includes L-theanine for smooth effect)
- **Black tea**: 40-70mg per cup

### Cycling
- **Option 1**: 5 days on, 2 days off (weekends)
- **Option 2**: 2 weeks on, 3 days off
- **Purpose**: Maintain sensitivity, prevent tolerance

### Notes
- Pair with L-theanine (100-200mg) for reduced jitters and improved focus
- Avoid on empty stomach if sensitive
- Reduce dose if experiencing anxiety or sleep issues

## Supplements for Cognitive Performance

### Tier 1: High Evidence, Low Risk
1. **Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)**: 2-3g per day
2. **Creatine monohydrate**: 5g per day (cognitive and physical performance)
3. **Vitamin D3**: 2,000-4,000 IU per day (if deficient)
4. **Magnesium**: 200-400mg per day (glycinate or threonate forms)

### Tier 2: Moderate Evidence, Low Risk
1. **Alpha-GPC or CDP-Choline**: 300-600mg per day (choline source)
2. **L-Theanine**: 100-200mg with caffeine (focus without jitters)
3. **Rhodiola Rosea**: 200-400mg per day (adaptogen, stress resilience)
4. **Bacopa Monnieri**: 300mg per day (memory, standardized extract)

### Tier 3: Experimental, Use with Caution
1. **Lion's Mane Mushroom**: 500-1000mg per day (NGF support, early research)

### Supplement Timing
- **Morning**: Omega-3, Vitamin D, Creatine, B vitamins
- **With caffeine**: L-Theanine
- **Evening**: Magnesium (supports sleep)
- **With meals**: Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), Omega-3

### Notes
- Start one supplement at a time
- Assess for 2-4 weeks before adding another
- Quality matters: Third-party tested brands
- Not a replacement for whole food nutrition

## Pre-Workout Nutrition (for HIIT or resistance training)

### 2 Hours Before
- **Meal**: Moderate protein (20-30g), moderate carbs (40-60g), low fat
- **Example**: Chicken with rice and vegetables

### 30-60 Minutes Before (if needed)
- **Snack**: Fast-digesting carbs, minimal protein/fat
- **Example**: Banana, white rice cake with honey, apple

### Immediately Before (optional)
- **Caffeine**: 100-200mg (if training in morning/early afternoon)
- **Water**: 500ml

### Avoid
- High-fiber foods within 2 hours
- High-fat meals within 3 hours
- Large portions within 2 hours

## Post-Workout Nutrition

### Within 30-60 Minutes
- **Protein**: 20-40g (whey, chicken, fish)
- **Carbs**: 0.5-1g per kg body weight (faster-digesting acceptable)
- **Example**: Protein shake with banana, or chicken with white rice

### Within 2 Hours (if first meal missed)
- **Regular meal**: Same macros as above, can include more fat

### Purpose
- Protein synthesis
- Glycogen replenishment
- Reduce muscle soreness
- Support recovery

## Meal Preparation Strategy

### Weekly Prep (2-3 hours, Sunday)
- **Proteins**: Cook 3-4 portions each of 2 protein sources
- **Carbs**: Cook large batches of rice, quinoa, or sweet potatoes
- **Vegetables**: Chop and store, or roast in bulk
- **Containers**: Portion into 4-6 containers for easy grab

### Daily Prep
- **Breakfast**: 5-10 min max (eggs, oats)
- **Lunch**: Use prepped components
- **Dinner**: 20-30 min cooking or use prepped items

### Efficiency Tips
- Use slow cooker or instant pot
- Batch cook grains and proteins
- Pre-cut vegetables
- Have backup frozen meals
- Keep staples stocked

## Tracking and Adjustment

### Variables to Monitor
- **Energy levels**: Rate 1-10 at morning, midday, evening
- **Cognitive performance**: Subjective focus quality during deep work
- **Sleep quality**: 1-10 rating
- **Digestion**: Any issues (bloating, discomfort)
- **Weight stability**: Weekly average

### Weekly Review
- Compare energy and performance with meal timing
- Identify patterns (crashes after certain foods/times)
- Adjust macros or timing by small increments

### Monthly Assessment
- Review 4 weeks of data
- Major adjustments if needed (±10% macros, timing shifts)
- Check if supplementation is effective

## Context-Specific Adjustments

### High Cognitive Load Days
- Increase protein slightly (10-15g)
- More frequent small meals
- Higher hydration
- Avoid afternoon carb-heavy meals

### High Physical Training Days
- Increase carbs by 50-100g
- Timing around training
- Higher hydration + electrolytes
- Ensure adequate post-workout nutrition

### Low Activity/Rest Days
- Reduce total calories by 10-15%
- Maintain protein
- Reduce carbs slightly
- Maintain nutrient density

### Travel or Disrupted Schedule
- Prioritize protein at every meal
- Carry portable options (nuts, protein bars, jerky)
- Maintain hydration (more critical when traveling)
- Accept imperfection, return to protocol when able

## Key Reminders

- Nutrition is a foundation, not a quick fix
- Consistency > perfection
- Individual variation exists (adjust based on response)
- Combine with sleep, exercise, and stress management
- Whole foods > supplements
- Plan ahead to reduce decision fatigue
