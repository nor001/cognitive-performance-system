# Cognitive Performance System

A structured knowledge and execution system for optimizing cognitive performance through evidence-based practices.

## Overview

This repository documents a personal cognitive operating system designed to maximize mental performance, productivity, and cognitive longevity. It is structured around six core pillars that work synergistically to support optimal brain function.

## Complete System Guide

**[📖 Read the Complete System Guide](./cognitive-performance-system-complete.md)** - All content consolidated in one comprehensive document.

## System Components

The complete guide covers these six core pillars:

1. **Daily Routines** - Time-structured daily protocols for consistent cognitive performance
2. **Work and Study Systems** - Methods and frameworks for effective learning and productive work
3. **HIIT Training** - High-intensity interval training protocols for cognitive enhancement
4. **Nutrition for Cognition** - Dietary strategies and meal timing for brain health and performance
5. **Sleep** - Sleep optimization protocols and architecture management
6. **Recovery** - Active and passive recovery strategies for cognitive restoration

## How to Use This System

1. **Start with the Daily Routines** - Establish a baseline structure
2. **Integrate Work and Study Systems** - Apply during productive hours
3. **Schedule HIIT Training** - 3-4 sessions per week
4. **Implement Nutrition Protocols** - Align with your daily schedule
5. **Optimize Sleep** - Non-negotiable foundation
6. **Apply Recovery Strategies** - Based on cognitive load

## Principles

- **Evidence-based**: All protocols are grounded in research
- **Iterative**: Continuously refine based on personal data
- **Systematic**: Structured and reproducible
- **Practical**: Actionable and implementable
- **Measurable**: Track inputs and outputs
