# Cognitive Performance System

A structured knowledge and execution system for optimizing cognitive performance through evidence-based practices.

## Overview

This repository documents a personal cognitive operating system designed to maximize mental performance, productivity, and cognitive longevity. It is structured around six core pillars that work synergistically to support optimal brain function.

## System Components

### 1. [Daily Routines](./daily-routines.md)
Time-structured daily protocols for consistent cognitive performance.

### 2. [Work and Study Systems](./work-study-systems.md)
Methods and frameworks for effective learning and productive work.

### 3. [HIIT Training](./hiit-training.md)
High-intensity interval training protocols for cognitive enhancement.

### 4. [Nutrition for Cognition](./nutrition.md)
Dietary strategies and meal timing for brain health and performance.

### 5. [Sleep](./sleep.md)
Sleep optimization protocols and architecture management.

### 6. [Recovery](./recovery.md)
Active and passive recovery strategies for cognitive restoration.

## How to Use This System

1. **Start with the Daily Routines** - Establish a baseline structure
2. **Integrate Work and Study Systems** - Apply during productive hours
3. **Schedule HIIT Training** - 3-4 sessions per week
4. **Implement Nutrition Protocols** - Align with your daily schedule
5. **Optimize Sleep** - Non-negotiable foundation
6. **Apply Recovery Strategies** - Based on cognitive load

## Principles

- **Evidence-based**: All protocols are grounded in research
- **Iterative**: Continuously refine based on personal data
- **Systematic**: Structured and reproducible
- **Practical**: Actionable and implementable
- **Measurable**: Track inputs and outputs
