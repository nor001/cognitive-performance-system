# Recovery

Strategic protocols for cognitive and physical restoration to maintain sustained high performance.

## Recovery Fundamentals

### Why Recovery Matters
- Prevents cognitive fatigue accumulation
- Maintains neuroplasticity
- Sustains long-term performance
- Reduces stress response
- Prevents burnout

### Types of Recovery
1. **Immediate**: Minutes to hours post-activity
2. **Short-term**: Day-to-day management
3. **Medium-term**: Weekly cycles
4. **Long-term**: Periodic extended breaks

## Daily Recovery

### Micro-Breaks (Every 90-120 min during work)
- Duration: 5-10 minutes
- Activities: Walk, stretch, deep breathing, eye rest
- Avoid: Switching to another demanding task, social media

### End-of-Day Shutdown (15 min)
1. Review what was accomplished
2. Capture open loops and next steps
3. Physical ritual (pack bag, close computer)
4. Transition walk or activity shift

## Active Recovery

### Light Movement (Daily)
- Walking: 30-60 min total (easy pace)
- Yoga/Stretching: 15-30 min (gentle to moderate)
- Swimming: 20-30 min (easy pace)

### Active Recovery Days (1-2 per week after intense training)
- Replace HIIT with low-intensity cardio: 30-45 min at 60-70% max HR
- Reduce deep work blocks to 1-2 maximum
- More frequent breaks

## Passive Recovery

### Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)
- Yoga Nidra or guided body scan: 10-30 min
- Timing: Afternoon (1300-1500) when fatigued
- Meditation: 10-20 min (breath focus or body scan)

### Optional: Sauna and Cold Exposure
- Sauna: 15-20 min at 170-195°F, 2-4x/week (if available)
- Cold shower: 1-3 min (morning for alertness, post-workout for recovery)
- Note: Not essential, but beneficial if accessible

## Cognitive Recovery

### Nature Exposure
- 20+ minutes daily in natural settings (parks, trails, water)
- Restores attention and reduces mental fatigue

### Novelty and Play
- Hobbies unrelated to work: 30-60 min, 2-3x/week
- Engages different neural circuits, reduces stress

### Social Connection
- Quality social time (meals, activities)
- Stress buffering and emotional support

## Stress Management

### Acute Stress
- **Physiological Sigh**: Double inhale (nose), extended exhale (mouth), 1-3 cycles
- **Box Breathing**: 4-sec inhale, 4-sec hold, 4-sec exhale, 4-sec hold, repeat 5-10x

### Chronic Stress
Assess total load (work, training, sleep, life events) and reduce through prioritization, boundaries, and scheduling buffer time.

## Recovery Foundations

Most critical recovery factors (in priority order):
1. **Sleep**: 7-9 hours, consistent timing (see [Sleep](./sleep.md))
2. **Nutrition**: Adequate protein, calories, hydration (see [Nutrition](./nutrition.md))
3. **Stress Management**: Address chronic stress
4. **Active Recovery**: Movement and light exercise
5. **Passive Recovery**: NSDR, meditation (optional: sauna, cold exposure)

## Key Principles

- Schedule recovery proactively, not reactively
- Consistency matters more than perfection
- Adjust based on how you feel and perform
- Recovery is training, not laziness
